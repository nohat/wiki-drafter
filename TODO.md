- [ ] Fix extension packaging warnings (repository field, LICENSE)
- [ ] Bundle extension for better performance
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement proper interval tree for claim offset management
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage

## üêõ Current Issues
- **Preview not rendering**: Parsoid not configured, fallback renderer broken
- **Claims grid empty**: Claim extraction not displaying results  
- **No cross-highlighting**: Claims don't highlight text in editor/preview
- **Keyboard shortcuts inactive**: Commands defined but handlers missing
- **Service endpoints untested**: API integration needs validation

## üìä Implementation Progress
- **Milestone 1**: ‚úÖ Complete (Scaffold & UI structure)
- **Milestone 2**: üîÑ In Progress (Basic rendering)
- **Milestones 3-10**: ‚è≥ Not started

**Current Focus**: Get basic preview rendering working to demonstrate the three-pane concept, then implement claim extraction display.
